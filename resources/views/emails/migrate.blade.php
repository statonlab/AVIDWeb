Hello {{ explode(' ', $user->name)[0] }},

We hope you’re having a great summer and staying safe. Nothing says “social distancing” quite like being alone in the woods as you measure your tagged seedlings and wildflowers.

We are excited to announce that we have been working with a super-talented group of web programmers from the University of Tennessee to repackage the AVID website. It looks similar to the original site, but has better functionality, top-end cyber security, and some very cool features (such as graphing data by year, location, county, etc.).   A summary of some of new features follows, but the key point of this email is to have you visit the new website at aviddeer.com and update your password. You can then see your data, and the exciting new features.

- Sidebar menu buttons for easier navigation
- A dashboard for a quick summary of your information and plots
- Option to set a reminder when it is time to re-measure your plants
- A much simpler online data entry interface
- Point and click location on Google map for GPS coordinates
- Ability to upload Excel files of your data (available by mid to late August)
- Available pre-formatted data sheets with your previous years’ data for you to print and take afield
- (This one is very cool) – Display data graphically with multiple filters to sort by county, location, year, species, protection status, etc.
- Ability to share sites with other team members so that you or others working with you can all have access (or not)
- An “Events” page where you can see upcoming AVID training (virtual and in-person) opportunities

Your participation with AVID helps protect the future health of forests in New York State.  We hope you take this opportunity to download your pre-formatted data sheets from the new site, and go make your 2020 measurements!  Please let us know if you have any questions.

We will send an instructions email to help you access the new website shortly.

Sincerely,<br>
Kristi, Peter, and Paul
    and University of Tennessee (Meg, Abdullah, and Joe)
